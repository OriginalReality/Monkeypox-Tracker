# Monkeypox-Tracker
This keeps track of Monkeypox infections by state using CDC data. The main purpose of this program is to notify the user when the number of infections in a state exceeds a given
threshold, which can be changed by the user. While the disease is not as common as Covid at this point (and hopefully never will be), I think this may be a convenient 
way to stay aware of how the disease is spreading without having to check the news everyday. 

I also included some code to keep track of the number of infections over time through a CSV file. However, this is unnecessary since I only included it there to collect data for machine learning purposes. It can be deleted without impacting the program's function.
